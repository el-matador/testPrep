question about finding out the character that occurs most in a given string.  

Questions about arrays and binary shift operations.  

simple graph question ( topological sort).  

Under NDA so can't explain much but it was more on data structure, OOP concepts, system design, quality, scalability, performance.  

Add a node to sorted circular linked list:


You have a string aaabbdcccccf, transform it the following way => a3b2d1c5f1 
ie: aabbaa -> a2b2a2 not a4b2

RPT (Remote programming test) based on Component dependency. C1 -> C2 and C3, Remove Component.

How to ensure locking in Singleton class  

Do a producer consumer problem  

Reach 2D Pt x to Pt y in spiral form -> right -> down -> left -> up moving 1 point at a time.  


find all words which start from particular letter (case insensitive)

- Remote Coding Test stage: implements components installer (implement the following methods: MakeDependency(component1, component2) // makes component1 dependent on component2
Install(component1) // installs component1 and components it is dependent upon (if they're not installed already)
Remove(component2) // removes component1 and components it is dependent upon if they're not used by other installed components.
Note: component1 can be dependent on component2 and component3; and component4 can be dependent on component2

- On-site interview: lots of technical questions like implement itoa, find kth largest in array, how to implement unit-tests, lots of behavioral questions.

Fire Eye:
Coding questions: String Compression problem, producer-consumer problem, readers-writers problem, check valid BST, improvise on the same problem with iterative tree traversal provided parent pointers in struct definition using O(1) extra space, implement strstr(), implement a simple regex matcher supporting '?' and '*' wildcards

Other questions include OS and Networking basics, difference between TCP/UDP and when to use them, TCP flow and congestion control algorithm (how TCP reacts to a certain scenario), HTTP header contents, What is DNS and its response types, What happens when you enter a URL in web browser, mutexes and critical section, draw stack and contents of a given C program, how to efficiently serialize and deserialize a tree using a database table (basically asked me to draw the fields of the SQL table and describe the process)

For a English dictionary
    - develop a fast server side api
    - consume any string
    - return a list of words in the dictionary that are permutations of the input string

For example:
    input: rta
    output: tar art rat

Given: 
    - dictionary is there with api for O(1) look up
    - finding all permutations from dictionary of input string to be developed
    - Once we have list of permutations, look into dictionary and return only those are found

     * Complete the function below.

        if(n ==0) {
            return new int[1];
        }
        
        result[0] = 0;
        if(n ==1) {
            return result;
        }
        
        result[1] = 1;
       
        if(n ==2) {
            return result;
        }
        
        for(int i =2; i<n ; i++) {
            result[i] = result[i-1] + result[i-2];
        }
          
        return result;
    }
